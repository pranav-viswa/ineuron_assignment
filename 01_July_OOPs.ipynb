    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, as well as in other programming languages, is to provide a<br> structured and modular approach to designing and organizing code. OOP focuses on creating objects that encapsulate data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key principles of OOP include:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: OOP allows you to bundle data and functions together into objects. Objects encapsulate data and provide methods to interact with and manipulate that data. This helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, making code more modular and easier to understand.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: OOP supports the concept of inheritance, where new classes can be derived from existing classes. Inheritance enables code reuse by allowing new classes to inherit the properties and behaviors of their parent classes. It promotes code organization, reduces duplication, and facilitates easier maintenance and extension of code.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably, providing a way to use a single interface to represent different types of objects. Polymorphism allows flexibility and extensibility in code by enabling the use of generic programming techniques and facilitating the creation of code that can handle a variety of object types.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: OOP encourages the use of abstract classes and interfaces to define common behavior and properties that subclasses can inherit. Abstraction allows programmers to focus on essential details while hiding unnecessary complexity. It helps in creating modular, maintainable, and loosely coupled code.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these principles, OOP in Python promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. It enables the creation of well-structured programs that are easier to understand, extend, and debug. OOP is particularly useful for building complex applications and systems where code organization and structure are crucial.<br>\n",
